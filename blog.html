      <h2>Goodreads Giveaway Equals Happiness</h2>
      <img id=blogPic class="img-fluid" src="img/image13.jpg" alt="Image of Book">
      <p id=blogPost>Like most writers I’m an avid reader. I’m never without a stack of books on my nightstand and usually have a book in my car or purse, too.
      <br />
      When you read a lot, it can be hard to keep of what you’ve read and what you want to read.
      <br />
      Enter Goodreads. It’s a delightfully easy way to track your reading, keep up with your favorite authors and discover new authors.
      <br />
      Goodreads also offers frequent book giveaways. Publishers  ship the book directly to the winner and there’s no obligation to read or review.
      <br />
      I only enter giveaways if the book is something I really want to read or it’s by a favorite author. I’ve entered a lot of giveaways and last month I was notified that I’d won a copy of “Aunt Dimity & The King’s Ransom” by Nancy Atherton. I was beyond thrilled!
      <br />
      The “Aunt Dimity” books are exceptionally well-crafted, delightful British cozies and I haven’t missed one.
      <br />
      This week my doorbell rang and the UPS man handed me my copy of “The King’s Ransom.”
      <br />
      I admit it.
      <br />
      I hugged it.  (At least I didn’t  hug the UPS man.) Then I whooped. And might have hollered.
      <br />
      My teenager rolled his eyes, but I didn’t care. Books make me happy. And free books make me even happier!
      <br />
      If you haven’t joined Goodreads yet, you really should. You can follow your favorite authors *hint*  Cindy Hval and connect with other readers.
      <br />
      Who knows? You may even win a free book</p>

      <h2>Like Andy Rooney but with better brows</h2>
      <img id=blogPic class="img-fluid" src="img/image14.jpg" alt="Image of Cindy">
      <p id="blogPost">I’m really excited about my latest adventure!
      <br />
      Beginning August 12, I’ll be part of the program Spokane Talks on Fox 28 Spokane.
      <br />
      Every Sunday at 6 PM, the half hour show offers news, views and conversation.
      <br />
      My three-minute Front Porch segments will end each program. Kind of like Andy Rooney on 60-minutes, but with well-groomed eyebrows and no, “Didya ever wonder…”</p>
      <img id=blogPic class="img-fluid" src="img/image15.jpg" alt="Image of Cindy">
      <p id="blogPost">I hope you’ll tune in to find out what the view from my Front Porch is like.
      <br />
      It’s usually rather sunny!</p>

      <h2>Preview my new book “Tiaras & Testosterone”</h2>
      <p id="blogPost">On Friday night, October 27 at Auntie’s Bookstore in Spokane I’ll be reading a sneak peek of Tiaras & Testosterone as part of author Kay Dixon’s launch of her newly released book Tales of Family Travel: Bathrooms of the World.
      <br />
      Kay has four daughters and I have four sons– we’ve got the family bases covered, and we covered it (and survived) with a huge amount of humor.
      <br />
      My first book War Bonds: Love Stories From the Greatest Generation (Casemate 2015) has been well-received and is still garnering great reviews. This time I’m tackling a more personal topic. For 10 years I’ve written a popular column for The Spokesman Review, chronicling my experience of life in a “man’s world” with poignancy, affection and a whopping dose of humor.
      <br />
      “Your columns read like what would happen if Anne Lamott and Erma Bombeck had a love child,” said one longtime subscriber.
      <br />
      Now, I’m collecting those columns in Tiaras & Testosterone.
      <br />
      Sections include Boy Crazy, Working from Home and Other Technical Difficulties, It’s a Woman’s World and Terrible Teens: Boys to Men.
      <br />
      Join Kay and I Friday night at 7 PM.  I would offer a money back guarantee of a good time, but the event is free.
      <br />
      And I’m an author 🙂</p>
